- 👋 Hi, I’m @Paweł Kaczmarek
- 
    I am a chef with many years of experience, but I intend to change industries.
A career in gastronomy has led me to the position of sous chef abroad.I am looking for new opportunities. In my work so far,
I have acquired a number of skills that will be useful in any environment requiring
good organization, strategic thinking, quick decision-making or team building.
My goal is to make use of these competences in a new field.



- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, django rest framework, React
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate as python developer or work with databases
-    I'm interested chess, jogging and bushcraft
